## Challenges we ran into

"If you are not facing challenges while developing an application, you are not considering every possible case for a better experience for your users."

During the ideation phase, we ran into problems regarding finding an optimum system that would not only be automated but also trustworthy. In the beginning we were going for a fully automated system using Artificial Intelligence, however, as we started to formulate a layout we realized that it may not be as reliable as a manually controlled system. Hence, to tackle this challenge we chose to move ahead with a semi-automated system. Next we had to come up with a novel yet feasible system and also had to ensure that it is simple, user-friendly and easy to understand.

Frontend and backend are the building blocks of a web application. 
While designing the frontend, we wished to implement authentication to keep the website safe, however, lacked the knowledge base for the same and learnt during the hackathon. Adding additional features like chat and notes-keeper to video conferencing was a big challenge.
Understanding the working of the backend side of our application was a big challenge as well since we had never worked with web backend before. However, thanks to online communities, stackoverflow, and our friends we were able to find resources which helped us in creating this web application.

All of these challenges were less of a challenge, and more of lessons, lessons to help us build an even better process for incorporating users' needs efficiently in the future.
